Job Search Engine

You are tasked with improving an existing project, a remote job search engine.
Today the task is to complete the project by inserting load indicators, error handling and redux-persist.

     
TASKS: (continue from where you left off previously)

1. Insert new actions and cases into your reducers to manage a loading indicator
            for asynchronous operations and possible errors, exactly as we did in class.
            Take advantage of these properties of the store and insert a Spinner and an Alert in the components affected by loading and/or errors to inform the user of these status changes.
         2. Install the redux-persist package (npm i redux-persist) and add it to your project with the appropriate configuration.
            The aim is to make your application capable of not losing Store information after a browser refresh.
         3. Keep the rest of the features intact.

[EXTRA]
         Install "redux-persist-transform-encrypt",
         written your copy of the Store in the localStorage and save the secretKey inside an .env file.



// Terminal:
   // npm i bootstrap@4.6.1
   // npm i react-bootstrap@1.6.5
   // npm i react-router-dom
   // npm i @reduxjs/toolkit
   // npm i react-redux
   // npm i redux-persist
   // npm install redux-persist-transform-encrypt
   
   
   



# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
